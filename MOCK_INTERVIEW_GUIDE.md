# Mock Interview Guide

Practice realistic interview sessions to build confidence and identify gaps before real interviews.

## Why mock interviews matter

- Test your problem-solving under time pressure
- Practice explaining your thought process out loud
- Build muscle memory for the interview format
- Get comfortable with being stuck and recovering

## How to use this guide

You can practice solo, with a peer, or with a mentor. Each mode has different benefits.

---

## Solo Mode (Self-Practice)

### Setup (5 minutes)
1. Pick 1 easy + 1 medium problem you haven't solved recently
2. Set a timer for 45 minutes total
3. Open a blank file or use paper/whiteboard
4. Turn off all distractions

### Session Flow (45 minutes)

**Problem 1 (20 minutes)**
- Read problem (2 min)
- Ask clarifying questions out loud (2 min)
- Explain approach before coding (3 min)
- Code solution (10 min)
- Test with examples (3 min)

**Problem 2 (25 minutes)**
- Read problem (3 min)
- Ask clarifying questions out loud (2 min)
- Explain approach before coding (5 min)
- Code solution (12 min)
- Test and explain complexity (3 min)

### Post-Session (10 minutes)
Answer these questions in writing:
1. Did I start coding too early without a clear plan?
2. Could I explain my approach in simple terms?
3. What edge cases did I miss initially?
4. Where did I get stuck, and how did I recover?
5. Did I communicate clearly (as if someone was listening)?

## Peer Mode (Practice with Another Learner)

### Roles
- **Candidate**: Solves the problem
- **Interviewer**: Asks questions, observes, gives feedback

### Before the session
- Interviewer picks 2 problems the candidate hasn't seen
- Agree on 45-minute time limit
- Use video call or in-person setup

### Interviewer Script

**Opening (2 min)**
- "Tell me about yourself briefly."
- "Here's your first problem. Read it and let me know when you're ready."

**During solving (15-20 min per problem)**
- Stay quiet unless candidate is stuck for 2+ minutes
- If stuck, give small hints: "What data structure tracks X efficiently?"
- Note: clarity, edge cases, communication, code quality

**Closing (2 min)**
- "Walk me through your solution one more time."
- "What's the time and space complexity?"

### Feedback Session (10 min)
Interviewer shares:
- ✅ What went well
- ⚠️ One area to improve
- 💡 One tactical tip for next time

### Trade Roles
Person who was interviewer now becomes candidate with 2 new problems.

## Mentor Mode (with Experienced Developer)

### Request Format (send to mentor)
```
Hi [Name],

I'm preparing for technical interviews and would love a 45-minute mock interview session.

My focus areas: [e.g., arrays/strings, binary search, trees]
My experience level: [e.g., solved 30 problems, junior dev with 1 year experience]

Would you be available for a session in the next week?

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### What to expect
- Mentor will simulate realistic interview pressure
- May ask behavioral questions first
- Expect follow-up questions like "How would you optimize this?"
- Feedback will be direct and helpful

### After the session
- Write down all feedback immediately
- Solve the same problems again 3 days later
- Track improvement in your [WEEKLY_CONFIDENCE_CHECK.md](WEEKLY_CONFIDENCE_CHECK.md)

## Scoring Rubric (Self-Assessment)

Rate yourself 1-5 on each dimension after every mock session.

| Dimension | 1 (Weak) | 3 (Average) | 5 (Strong) |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Problem Understanding** | Missed key constraints | Understood after re-reading | Clarified edge cases upfront |
| **Approach Communication** | Jumped into code | Explained vaguely | Clear plan before coding |
| **Code Quality** | Many bugs, poor naming | Working but messy | Clean, modular, idiomatic |
| **Testing** | Did not test | Tested happy path only | Tested edge cases proactively |
| **Time Management** | Did not finish | Finished with no time left | Finished with time for review |
| **Complexity Analysis** | Could not explain | Approximated correctly | Precise with justification |

### Target scores
- **Ready for interviews**: 4+ average across all dimensions
- **Need more practice**: 2-3 average (focus on 1-2 weak areas)
- **Keep building fundamentals**: <2 average (solve more problems first)

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Starting to code immediately | Always explain approach first (30 seconds minimum) |
| Silent for long periods | Narrate your thinking: "I'm considering X vs Y because..." |
| Not testing your solution | Walk through 1 example and 1 edge case out loud |
| Giving up when stuck | Say "I'm stuck on X, let me try Y approach" |
| Overcomplicating | Start with brute force, then optimize if time permits |

---

## Mock Interview Schedule (Recommended)

**Weeks 1-4**: Solo mode, 1x per week  
**Weeks 5-8**: Peer mode, 1x per week  
**Weeks 9-12**: Mentor mode, 1x every 2 weeks + solo practice

Log every session in your [LEARNING_PATH_CHECKLIST.md](LEARNING_PATH_CHECKLIST.md).

## Next Steps

1. Schedule your first solo mock interview within 3 days
2. Complete the post-session reflection
3. Identify your weakest scoring dimension
4. Practice that specific skill in your next 3 study sessions
5. Run another mock and measure improvement
