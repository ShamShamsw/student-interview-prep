# 26. Reverse Linked List

Difficulty: Easy  
Topics: linked-list, recursion

Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list.

Examples
- Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
  Output: `[5,4,3,2,1]`

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

Hints (optional)
- Use two pointers (`prev`, `curr`) and reverse links one-by-one.
