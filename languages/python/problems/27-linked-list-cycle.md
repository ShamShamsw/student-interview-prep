# 27. Linked List Cycle

Difficulty: Easy  
Topics: linked-list, two-pointers

Statement
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

Examples
- Input: `head = [3,2,0,-4]`, `pos = 1`  
  Output: `true`

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

Hints (optional)
- Use fast and slow pointers; if they meet, a cycle exists.
