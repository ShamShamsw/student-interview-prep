# 20. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: array, binary-search

Statement
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times.

Given the rotated sorted array `nums` with unique elements, return the minimum element.

Examples
- Input: `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`  
  Output: `1`

Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All elements are unique.

Hints (optional)
- Compare middle element to right boundary.
