# 16. Two Sum II — Input Array Is Sorted

Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: array, two-pointers

Statement
Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers that add up to a target number.

Return their indices as `[index1, index2]` with `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Examples
- Input: `numbers = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`  
  Output: `[1,2]`

Constraints
- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- Exactly one solution exists.

Hints (optional)
- Start one pointer at each end and move based on sum.
