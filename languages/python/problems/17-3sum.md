# 17. 3Sum

Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: array, two-pointers, sorting

Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return all unique triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i`, `j`, and `k` are distinct and the sum is `0`.

Examples
- Input: `nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`  
  Output: `[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]`

Constraints
- `3 <= nums.length <= 3000`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

Hints (optional)
- Sort first, then fix one number and use two pointers.
