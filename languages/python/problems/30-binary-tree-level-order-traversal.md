# 30. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: tree, breadth-first-search

Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

Examples
- Input: `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`  
  Output: `[[3],[9,20],[15,7]]`

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

Hints (optional)
- Use a queue and process one level at a time.
