# 28. Merge Two Sorted Lists

Difficulty: Easy  
Topics: linked-list, recursion

Statement
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list and return the head of the merged list.

Examples
- Input: `list1 = [1,2,4]`, `list2 = [1,3,4]`  
  Output: `[1,1,2,3,4,4]`

Constraints
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

Hints (optional)
- Use a dummy node to build the merged list iteratively.
