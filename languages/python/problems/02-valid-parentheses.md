Statement
Given a string `s` containing only the characters `()[]{}`, determine if the input string is valid.

Examples
- Input: `s = "()[]{}"`  
  Output: `true`

Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists only of parentheses characters.

Hints (optional)
- Use a stack to track expected closing brackets.
