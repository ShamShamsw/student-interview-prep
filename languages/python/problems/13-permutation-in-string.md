Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: string, sliding-window

Statement
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, otherwise return `false`.

Examples
- Input: `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidbaooo"`  
  Output: `true`

Constraints
- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 10^4`

Hints (optional)
