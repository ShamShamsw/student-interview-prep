# 01. Two Sum

Difficulty: Easy  
Topics: array, hash-table

Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Examples
- Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`  
  Output: `[0,1]`

Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

Hints (optional)
- Use a dictionary to track values seen so far and their indices.
