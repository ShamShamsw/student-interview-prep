# 18. Container With Most Water

Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: array, two-pointers, greedy

Statement
Given `n` non-negative integers `height` where each represents a vertical line, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container containing the most water.

Return the maximum area.

Examples
- Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`  
  Output: `49`

Constraints
- `2 <= height.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

Hints (optional)
- Move the shorter pointer inward each step.
