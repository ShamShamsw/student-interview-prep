# 10. Encode and Decode Strings

Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: string, design

Statement
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string and decode it back.

The encoded string should be lossless and support empty strings.

Examples

  Output: a reversible encoded string

Constraints
- `0 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`

Hints (optional)
- Prefix each string with its length and a delimiter.
