# Beginner Project 25: Personal Finance Tracker With Forecasts

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Focus:** CSV transaction ingestion, category mapping, monthly budget summaries, and linear cashflow forecasting

## Why This Project?

Managing personal finances requires more than a spreadsheet. Production-grade finance tools must import raw bank exports, normalize inconsistent transaction descriptions, categorize expenses reliably, produce month-by-month summaries, and project future balances.

This project teaches a professional data pipeline where you can:

- import transactions from CSV files exported by any bank,
- normalize and parse dates and amount fields robustly,
- apply category rules to classify each transaction automatically,
- aggregate spending by category and month,
- compute running balances across the full date range,
- forecast future cashflow using linear regression on historical net values,
- render an interactive forecast chart using Plotly,
- and persist all outputs to disk for later review.

## What You Will Build

You will build a command-line finance tracker that:

1. Accepts a CSV file of bank transactions (date, description, amount).
2. Applies a configurable keyword-to-category map to each transaction.
3. Computes monthly income, expense, and net totals.
4. Builds a running balance timeline from a configurable starting balance.
5. Forecasts future monthly balances using linear regression.
6. Renders an interactive HTML forecast chart with Plotly.
7. Prints categorization counts, monthly tables, and a forecast table to the console.
8. Persists processed transactions and a run summary to disk.
