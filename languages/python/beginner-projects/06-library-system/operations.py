operations.py — Business logic for the Library Management System
==================================================================

This module contains all the rules and logic. It:
    - Calls storage.py to read/write data
    - Calls models.py to create new entities
    - Enforces business rules (max 3 loans, can't remove loaned books, etc.)
    - NEVER prints anything — returns results for display.py to format

Why "never prints":
    Separating logic from output makes functions testable. You can call
    checkout_book() in a test and check the return value without capturing
    stdout. It also means you could build a web UI that calls the same
    operations — the logic doesn't assume a terminal.

BUILD THIS MODULE THIRD (after storage.py and models.py).

If You Get Stuck:
    Use an AI assistant to ASK QUESTIONS about logic — for example:
      "How do I count items in a list that match a condition in Python?"
      "How do I compare date strings in Python?"
    DO NOT ask AI to write the solution. Business logic is the heart of
    any application — this is where the real learning happens.

        query (str): The search term.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: Matching books.

    Algorithm:
        For each book, check if query.lower() appears in any of

    Calculation:
        available = total_copies - active_loans_for_this_book
        An active loan has return_date == None.

    Why calculate instead of store:
        If we stored available_copies, a bug in checkout/return could
        make it inconsistent with reality. Calculating from loans is
        always correct — "single source of truth."
