display.py — Output formatting for the Library Management System
==================================================================

All print formatting lives here. Functions accept data and return
formatted strings. They generally do NOT call print() themselves —
the caller in main.py decides when to print.

Why separate display from logic:
    1. Testability: compare strings in tests without capturing stdout
    2. Flexibility: same data could be formatted as text, HTML, or PDF
    3. Single responsibility: changing a column width doesn't risk
       breaking checkout logic

BUILD THIS MODULE FOURTH (after storage, models, and operations).

If You Get Stuck:
    Use an AI assistant to ASK QUESTIONS — for example:
      "How do I left-align text in a Python f-string?"
      "How do box-drawing characters work in Python strings?"
    DO NOT ask AI to write the whole function. Formatting is tedious
    but learning f-string alignment is a skill you'll use forever.

def _truncate(text, width):
    """
    Truncate text to fit within a given width.

    Parameters:
        text (str): The string to truncate.
        width (int): Maximum character width.

    Returns:
        str: Original text if it fits, or text[:width-1] + "…" if too long.

    Why truncate instead of wrapping:
        Tables need fixed column widths to align properly. Wrapping
        would break the alignment. Truncation with an ellipsis shows
        the user that text was cut off.

    # Hint: if len(text) <= width: return text
    #       return text[:width - 1] + "…"

def format_books_table(books, loans):
    """
    Format a list of books as a bordered table with availability.

    Parameters:
        books (list[dict]): Book records.
        loans (list[dict]): All loans (needed to calculate availability).

    Returns:
        str: A formatted table string ready to print.

    Columns: ID | Title | Author | Genre | Availability
    Availability shows "X/Y available" where X = total - active loans.

    Why this function needs loans:
        Available copies = total_copies - active loans for that book.
        It's calculated, not stored (single source of truth).
    """
    # TODO: Implement this function
    # Hints:
    #   - If no books, return "No books in the library."
    #   - Define column widths (e.g., ID: 6, Title: 30, Author: 20, Genre: 10, Avail: 15)
    #   - Build header row, separator, data rows, footer
    #   - For availability: count loans where book_id matches AND return_date is None
    #   - Use f-string alignment: f"{value:<width}" for left-align
    #   - You can use simple borders (|, -, +) or box-drawing characters
    #
    # Simple table example:
    #   | ID   | Title                   | Author          | Available |
    #   |------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------|

    Format a list of members as a table.

    Parameters:
        members (list[dict]): Member records.

    Columns: ID | Name | Email | Joined

    Format a list of loans as a table with status info.

    Parameters:
        loans (list[dict]): Loan records (should be enriched with

    Returns:
        str: Formatted table string.

    Columns: Loan ID | Book | Member | Due Date | Status
    Status shows either "OVERDUE" or "X days left" based on due date.
    """
    # TODO: Implement this

        books (list[dict]): ALL books (for title lookups).

    Returns:
        str: Multi-section profile string.

    Sections:
        1. Member info (name, email, join date)
        2. Current loans (active, with due dates and overdue warnings)

    Bar chart: same approach as the expense tracker —
        largest genre gets full bar, others are proportional.
