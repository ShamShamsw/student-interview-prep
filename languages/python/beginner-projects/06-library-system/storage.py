"""
storage.py — Data persistence layer for the Library Management System
=======================================================================

Responsible for reading and writing JSON data files. No other module
should touch the filesystem directly — all data access goes through
this module.

BUILD THIS MODULE FIRST. Nothing else works without save/load.

Why JSON and not a database:
    For a project this size, JSON files are simpler to debug (you can
    open them in any text editor), require no extra dependencies, and
    teach the same persistence concepts. In a real library system,
    you'd use a relational database (PostgreSQL, SQLite) — see stretch goals.

File locations:
    All data files live in the data/ subdirectory, relative to this script.
    Using a subdirectory keeps data files separate from code files.

If You Get Stuck:
    Use an AI assistant to ASK QUESTIONS about concepts — for example:
      "How does os.path.dirname(__file__) work?"
      "What's the difference between json.load and json.loads?"
    DO NOT ask AI to write the solution. Understanding file I/O is a
    fundamental skill — let your brain do the work.

import json
import os

# Path to the data directory — calculated relative to THIS file's location.
# os.path.dirname(__file__) gives us the folder containing storage.py,
# so this works regardless of where the user runs the program from.
# This is more robust than hardcoded "data/" which breaks if you
# run the script from a different working directory.
DATA_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "data")


def _ensure_data_dir():
    """
    Create the data/ directory if it doesn't exist.

    Called internally before any save operation. The leading underscore
    signals this is a private helper — not part of the public API.

    Why os.makedirs with exist_ok=True instead of checking os.path.exists:
        Avoids a race condition: between checking "does it exist?" and
        creating it, something else could create it, causing an error.
        exist_ok=True handles this safely.

def load_data(filename):
    """
    Load a JSON data file and return its contents.

    Parameters:
        filename (str): Name of the file (e.g., "books.json").
                        Will be loaded from the data/ directory.

    Returns:
        list[dict]: The parsed JSON data. Returns an empty list if the
        file doesn't exist yet (first run).

    Why return an empty list instead of raising an error:
        On first run, no data files exist. Treating "no file" as "no data"
        means the rest of the code doesn't need special first-run handling.

    # TODO: Implement this function
    # Hints:
    #   - Build the full path: os.path.join(DATA_DIR, filename)
    #   - Use try/except for FileNotFoundError and json.JSONDecodeError
    #   - Return [] if the file doesn't exist or is corrupted

    Write data to a JSON file in the data/ directory.

        data (list[dict]): The data to serialize.

    Returns:
        None

    Implementation notes:
        - Calls _ensure_data_dir() first (creates folder if needed)
        - Uses indent=2 for human-readable JSON (easy to debug)
        - Uses ensure_ascii=False so names with accents display correctly
