main.py — Entry point for the Library Management System
=========================================================

This module handles all user interaction: displaying menus, reading
input, and routing to the appropriate operations. It follows the
"thin controller" pattern — minimal logic here, mostly delegation.

Architecture:
    User input → main.py → operations.py → storage.py → JSON files
    Display   ← main.py ← display.py

    main.py is the only module that uses input() or print().
    Every other module is "pure" (no I/O side effects), which
    makes the system testable and maintainable.

YOUR TASK: Fill in every function marked with TODO.
Read the README.md in this folder FIRST for the full instructions.

TIME ESTIMATE: 2.5–4 hours (for the ENTIRE project, not just this file)

IMPORTANT — If You Get Stuck:
    1. Re-read the README section for the step you're on.
    2. Build and test ONE module at a time, in this order:
       storage.py → models.py → operations.py → display.py → main.py
    3. Use an AI assistant (like Copilot Chat) to ASK QUESTIONS about
       concepts you don't understand — for example:
         "How do I import functions from another file in Python?"
         "How do I calculate the difference between two dates?"
         "What does 'foreign key' mean in plain English?"
       DO NOT ask AI to write the solution for you. The learning happens
       when YOUR brain figures out how to connect the pieces. AI is a
       tutor, not a shortcut. If AI writes your code, you skip the
       struggle that actually builds understanding.

DATA MODEL RELATIONSHIPS
============================================================

    Member (1) ──────< (many) Loan >────── (1) Book

    In plain English:
      - One member can have many active loans
      - Each loan belongs to exactly one member and one book
      - A book can only be checked out if it has available copies

    This is a classic "many-to-many through a join entity" pattern.
    In a database, the Loan table acts as a junction/bridge table
    between Members and Books. Here we model it with dictionaries
    and use IDs to link them — exactly how a relational database works.

    Why IDs instead of nested objects:
      If we stored the full member dict inside each loan dict, we'd
      have duplicated data. Change a member's name and you'd need to
      update it in every loan. IDs avoid this — look up the current
      member data by ID when you need it. This is "normalization."

FILE ARCHITECTURE
============================================================

    06-library-system/
    ├── main.py          ← You are here. Menu loop, user interaction.
    ├── models.py        ← Data creation: create_book(), create_member(), etc.
    ├── storage.py       ← Persistence: load/save JSON data files.
    ├── operations.py    ← Business logic: checkout, return, search, overdue.
    ├── display.py       ← Formatting: tables, reports, summaries.
    └── data/            ← JSON data files (created automatically).
        ├── books.json
        ├── members.json
        └── loans.json

    Data flows one direction: main.py → operations.py → storage.py
    Display is called from main.py but never modifies data.

PLANNING (fill in your answers below)
============================================================

    Build order:
        1. storage.py — save and load JSON files (test with hardcoded data)
        2. models.py — create_book, create_member, create_loan (test with print)
        3. operations.py — add_book, add_member (test: add → save → reload)
        4. display.py — format_books_table (test with hardcoded data)
        5. main.py — books menu (integrate: add + list books)
        6. operations.py — checkout and return (the hard part!)
        7. main.py — loans menu
        8. operations.py — overdue detection and reports

    Business rules:
        - Max 3 active loans per member
        - Can't check out a book with 0 available copies
        - Can't remove a book that has active loans
        - Return date = None means the loan is active

    ID generation strategy:
        - Format: "B001", "M001", "L001" (prefix + 3-digit number)
        - Find max existing ID, add 1
        - (What if you delete ID B002 then add a new book? It gets B004,
          not B002. IDs are never reused — like database auto-increment.)

    Display the top-level menu and route to sub-menus.

    Loop structure:

        Only "Quit" breaks the loop.

    Why nested menu functions instead of one giant menu:
        A single function with 15+ options is hard to read. Sub-menus
        keep each function focused on one entity. Adding a new book
        operation means editing only books_menu().
