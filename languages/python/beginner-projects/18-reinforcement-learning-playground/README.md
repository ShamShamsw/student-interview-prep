# Beginner Project 18: Reinforcement Learning Playground

**Time:** 3-5 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Focus:** tabular Q-learning, epsilon-greedy exploration, policy evaluation, baseline comparison, and learning curve analysis

---

## Why This Project?

Reinforcement learning teaches agents to make sequential decisions through trial and error.
This project gives you a practical beginner workflow where you can:

- build and train a tabular Q-learning agent in a custom GridWorld,
- explore how learning rate, discounting, and exploration schedules affect behavior,
- compare a learned policy against a simple random-action baseline,
- interpret learning dynamics through reward and success-rate curves,
- and save training runs for reproducibility and later analysis.

## What You Will Build

You will build a command-line reinforcement learning playground that:

1. Defines a deterministic GridWorld environment with start, goal, trap, obstacles, and reward shaping.
2. Trains a tabular Q-learning agent using an epsilon-greedy policy over hundreds of episodes.
3. Tracks per-episode rewards, steps, and success outcomes through the full training run.
4. Evaluates the learned greedy policy on held-out episodes to estimate performance.
5. Runs a random-action baseline policy for direct, interpretable comparison.
6. Computes summary metrics including success-rate gain and reward improvement over baseline.
7. Saves JSON artifacts and learning-curve plots for reproducibility and review.
