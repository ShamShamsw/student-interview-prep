# Beginner Projects

Five plan-first, comment-heavy projects designed for **absolute beginners** who have basic Python knowledge (variables, if/else, loops, functions) but haven't built anything from scratch yet.

## Philosophy

These projects emphasize **planning over programming**:

- Every project starts with a "STOP — Plan Before You Code" section
- You write 30–80 lines of comments and docstrings before writing any working code
- Each project introduces a specific commenting skill (header comments → docstrings → algorithm comments → architecture comments → teammate-ready documentation)

## Projects

| # | Project | Time | Difficulty | Key Skills |
|---|---------|------|------------|------------|
| 01 | [Greeting Generator](01-greeting-generator/README.md) | 30–45 min | Absolute Beginner | String formatting, conditionals, planning comments |
| 02 | [Quiz Game](02-quiz-game/README.md) | 45–75 min | Beginner | Lists, dictionaries, functions, docstrings |
| 03 | [Contact Book](03-contact-book/README.md) | 1–1.5 hr | Beginner | CRUD, JSON persistence, architecture comments |
| 04 | [Expense Tracker](04-expense-tracker/README.md) | 1–2 hr | Beginner | Aggregation, formatted output, algorithm comments |
| 05 | [Student Grade Report](05-grade-report/README.md) | 1.5–2 hr | Beginner+ | CSV processing, multi-section reports, full documentation |

## Recommended Order

Work through the projects in order — each one builds on commenting and planning skills from the previous one:

1. **Greeting Generator** — learn to write a planning block and header comments
2. **Quiz Game** — learn to write docstrings and plan data structures
3. **Contact Book** — learn to document architecture decisions and data persistence
4. **Expense Tracker** — learn to write algorithm comments and explain trade-offs
5. **Grade Report** — combine all skills into teammate-ready documentation

## What "Done" Looks Like

A completed project should have:
- A planning block at the top of the file (comments written BEFORE coding)
- Every function with a complete docstring
- Inline comments explaining WHY, not WHAT
- A comment-to-code ratio of at least 1:3 (one comment line per three code lines)
- Working code that matches the example output in the README
