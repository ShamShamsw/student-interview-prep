# Beginner Project 49: Image Colorization Demo

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Focus:** Deterministic grayscale-to-color strategy simulation, pixel-level error analysis, persistent history, and runtime/error visualizations

## Why This Project?

Image colorization is a great way to learn computer vision workflows without needing a heavy deep-learning stack on day one. This project keeps the pipeline lightweight and reproducible by using synthetic grayscale scenes, reference color generation, and rule-based colorization strategies that can be benchmarked side by side.

This project teaches end-to-end colorization workflow concepts where you can:

- load or auto-seed a reusable synthetic image library for deterministic demos,
- generate grayscale image grids with configurable tone, contrast, and texture,
- produce reference RGB targets from image profile characteristics,
- compare warm-map, cool-map, and adaptive blend colorization strategies,
- track per-pixel error and cumulative error across full image traversal,
- estimate quality with mean pixel error, PSNR proxy, and close-match percentage,
- persist session and sampled-pixel history for reproducible audit trails,
- benchmark strategy runtime across increasing image widths,
- visualize runtime behavior as a multi-series chart,
- visualize cumulative color error trend for selected strategy,
- export trace bundles and benchmark bundles to JSON for inspection,
- persist historical run summaries for repeatable profiling,
- and print a readable terminal report with pixel previews and artifact paths.

## What You Will Build

You will build an image colorization simulation workflow that:

1. Loads image definitions from `data/image_sets.json` (or seeds a starter set of 4 image profiles).
2. Selects a deterministic demo image profile for strategy walkthroughs.
3. Generates a synthetic grayscale grid for the configured width and height.
4. Creates reference RGB targets from profile warmth/tone settings.
5. Simulates warm-map, cool-map, and adaptive blend strategies over all pixels.
6. Compares strategy quality using mean pixel error, PSNR estimate, and pixel match rate.
7. Stores session and sampled-pixel events in `data/colorization_history.json`.
8. Benchmarks strategy runtime across configured image widths and repeated trials.
9. Aggregates runtime points into strategy-level average performance summaries.
10. Saves a strategy runtime chart under `data/outputs/`.
11. Saves a cumulative error trend chart under `data/outputs/`.
12. Persists trace, benchmark, and run-summary artifacts for future sessions.
13. Maintains a run catalog in `data/runs.json` for startup profiling.
