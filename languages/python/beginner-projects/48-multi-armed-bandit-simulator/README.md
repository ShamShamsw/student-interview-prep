# Beginner Project 48: Multi-Armed Bandit Simulator

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Focus:** Exploration-vs-exploitation strategy simulation, policy benchmarking, persistent run history, and runtime/regret visualizations

---

## Why This Project?

Multi-armed bandits are one of the most practical entry points to reinforcement learning and online optimization. Instead of training a heavy model, bandits let you learn from immediate feedback and balance exploration with exploitation over time. This project turns that concept into a reproducible simulator workflow where you can compare policies, inspect action traces, and track regret trends across repeated sessions.

This project teaches end-to-end bandit simulation workflow concepts where you can:

- load or auto-seed a reusable arm library for deterministic demos,
- run a fixed-horizon online decision process over multiple reward arms,
- compare epsilon-greedy, UCB, and Thompson sampling side by side,
- track cumulative reward and cumulative regret across step sequences,
- persist session and step-level history for reproducible audit trails,
- benchmark policy runtime across increasing horizon lengths,
- visualize runtime behavior as a multi-series chart,
- visualize regret behavior as a trend chart across decisions,
- export trace bundles and benchmark bundles to JSON for inspection,
- persist historical run summaries for repeatable profiling,
- and print a readable terminal report with step previews and artifact paths.

## What You Will Build

You will build a multi-armed bandit simulation workflow that:

1. Loads arm definitions from `data/arm_sets.json` (or seeds a starter set of 6 arms).
2. Selects a deterministic demo sequence for policy walkthroughs.
3. Simulates reward pulls under epsilon-greedy, UCB, and Thompson sampling.
4. Compares policy quality using cumulative reward, average reward, and regret.
5. Stores session and sampled-step events in `data/bandit_history.json`.
6. Benchmarks policy runtime across configured horizon lengths and repeated trials.
7. Aggregates runtime points into strategy-level average performance summaries.
8. Saves a strategy runtime chart under `data/outputs/`.
9. Saves a cumulative regret trend chart under `data/outputs/`.
10. Persists trace, benchmark, and run-summary artifacts for future sessions.
11. Maintains a run catalog in `data/runs.json` for startup profiling.
