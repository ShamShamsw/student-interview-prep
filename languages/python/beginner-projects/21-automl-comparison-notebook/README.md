# Beginner Project 21: AutoML Comparison Notebook

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Focus:** Model benchmarking, hyperparameter tuning, train/validation/test workflows, cross-validation, and performance metric tracking

---

## Why This Project?

Machine learning in the real world is not about building one perfect model—it's about **systematically comparing models and hyperparameter choices** to find what works best for your data.

This project teaches you a professional ML workflow where you can:

- generate or load tabular datasets with train/validation/test splits,
- build wrappers for multiple model types (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM),
- run hyperparameter grids (grid search) or random search to find good settings,
- track and compare model performance across train, validation, and test sets,
- visualize metric trends and confusion matrices to understand model behavior,
- save benchmarking results and comparison reports for reproducibility and analysis.

## Separate Repository

You can also access this project in a separate repository:

[AutoML Comparison Notebook Repository](https://github.com/ShamShamsw/automl-comparison-notebook.git)

---

## What You Will Build

You will build a command-line AutoML benchmark system that:

1. Generates or loads a tabular dataset (e.g., binary classification) with train/val/test splits.
2. Defines a modular model interface (fit, predict, score) for multiple algorithms.
3. Implements model classes for at least 3 algorithms (e.g., LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest).
4. Builds a hyperparameter grid or random search that trains models with different settings.
5. Evaluates each trained model on train, validation, and test sets with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC).
6. Tracks the winning model and its hyperparameters.
7. Generates a comparison report showing all models ranked by test performance.
8. Saves a JSON summary of the benchmarking session including all configurations, results, and the best model metadata.
9. Visualizes metric trends across epochs/folds and confusion matrices for the best model.

## Build Order

Follow this order for clean architecture:

1. `storage.py` — Load/save datasets and results JSON
2. `models.py` — Define model wrappers and configuration
3. `operations.py` — Implement grid search, training, evaluation
4. `display.py` — Format tables, plots, and reports
5. `main.py` — Orchestrate the full benchmark workflow

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Implement `storage.py`

Create functions to:
- Load or generate a synthetic tabular dataset (use `sklearn.datasets.make_classification`)
- Split into train/val/test (60/20/20 or configurable)
- Save and load results as JSON
- Ensure `data/` directory exists

**Key functions:**
- `load_or_generate_dataset()` → returns X, y, feature_names
- `train_val_test_split()` → returns X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test
- `save_benchmark_results()` → saves JSON with all model configs and metrics
- `load_benchmark_results()` → loads previously saved results

### Step 2: Implement `models.py`

Define model classes and configuration:
- Base model interface (abstract or minimal)
- Wrapper classes for LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest
- Each wrapper implements: `fit()`, `predict()`, `predict_proba()`, `score()`
- Configuration dataclass/dict for each model with hyperparameter grid

**Key structures:**
- `create_model_config(model_name: str, hyperparams: dict) → dict`
- `fit_model(model_name: str, X_train, y_train, hyperparams) → model`
- `evaluate_model(model, X, y) → metrics_dict` (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC)

### Step 3: Implement `operations.py`

Build the core benchmark workflow:
- Grid search over model types and hyperparameters
- For each configuration: fit on train, evaluate on train/val/test
- Track best model and all results
- Generate comparison rankings

**Key functions:**
- `run_grid_search(X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test) → results`
- `run_core_flow() → summary` (orchestrates full pipeline)

### Step 4: Implement `display.py`

Format output for readability:
- Header with configuration summary
- Progress indicator (simple text or progress bar)
- Comparison table (model name, metrics)
- Confusion matrix ASCII art or saved plot
- Final summary with best model details

**Key functions:**
- `format_header() → str`
- `format_config_summary(config) → str`
- `format_results_table(results) → str`
- `format_metrics_report(best_model_metrics) → str`

### Step 5: Implement `main.py`

Orchestrate the workflow:
1. Load or generate dataset
2. Print configuration and dataset profile
3. Run benchmark (grid search)
4. Print best model and comparison table
5. Save results to JSON
6. Generate and save plots

## Done Criteria

- [ ] The project runs from `main.py` without crashes.
- [ ] At least 3 different model types are benchmarked.
- [ ] Grid search tries at least 12 different hyperparameter configurations.
- [ ] Train/validation/test metrics are tracked separately.
- [ ] A JSON summary file is saved with all results.
- [ ] A comparison table shows all models ranked by test performance.
- [ ] The best model's metrics are displayed clearly.
- [ ] Code is organized by concern (models, operations, display, storage).
- [ ] Every function has a docstring.

## Stretch Goals

1. Implement random search instead of (or in addition to) grid search.
2. Add cross-validation (k-fold CV) for more robust validation metrics.
3. Visualize learning curves (train/val loss vs. epoch) for models that support it.
4. Plot confusion matrices for the best model.
5. Export a detailed PDF report with all metrics and visualizations.
6. Allow users to load their own CSV dataset instead of synthetic.
7. Add feature importance plots for tree-based models.
8. Implement early stopping if val performance plateaus.
