# Beginner Project 30: Genetic Algorithm Visualizer

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Focus:** Evolutionary optimization, selection/crossover/mutation, fitness tracking, and run visualization

---

## Why This Project?

Genetic algorithms are a practical way to solve optimization problems when exact methods are hard or expensive. This project helps you learn how stochastic search converges over generations and how parameter choices affect convergence speed and solution quality.

This project teaches evolutionary computation where you can:

- represent candidate solutions as genomes,
- define a normalized fitness function for optimization,
- evolve populations with tournament selection,
- combine genes via single-point crossover,
- explore mutation for search-space diversity,
- track best/average/worst fitness over generations,
- visualize optimization progression with charts,
- persist run summaries and full generation histories,
- tune parameters (mutation, elitism, population size),
- and evaluate convergence behavior across repeated runs.

## What You Will Build

You will build a genetic algorithm visualizer that:

1. Encodes candidate solutions as fixed-length genomes.
2. Solves a string-matching optimization target using normalized fitness.
3. Initializes a reproducible random population from a configurable gene pool.
4. Applies tournament selection to choose fitter parents.
5. Uses single-point crossover to create child genomes.
6. Mutates genes probabilistically to maintain exploration.
7. Preserves elite individuals between generations.
8. Tracks generation metrics (best/avg/worst fitness and diversity).
9. Exports run artifacts (run summary JSON, history JSON, fitness chart).
10. Prints a readable terminal report showing optimization progress and outcomes.
