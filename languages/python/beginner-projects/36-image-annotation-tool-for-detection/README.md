# Beginner Project 36: Image Annotation Tool For Detection

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate Beginner  
**Focus:** Bounding-box validation, multi-format export (COCO/YOLO/VOC), and persistent detection annotation analytics

---

## Why This Project?

Object detection models are only as good as the annotation data used to train them. This project demonstrates how to build a practical annotation pipeline in pure Python, where image metadata and bounding boxes are normalized and exported in standard formats.

This project teaches end-to-end detection dataset workflow concepts where you can:

- load or auto-generate a reusable local image annotation library,
- validate and clip bounding boxes against image boundaries,
- compute area metrics from pixel-space bounding boxes,
- convert annotations from XYWH pixel coordinates to YOLO normalized format,
- export structured COCO-style JSON with image, annotation, and category blocks,
- generate Pascal VOC XML files per image with object bounding boxes,
- persist run summaries and per-annotation metadata to JSON,
- compute dataset-level quality metrics from annotation distributions,
- track recent annotations and historical run catalogs,
- and print a readable terminal report with preview rows and export paths.

## Separate Repository

You can also access this project in a separate repository:

## What You Will Build

You will build an image annotation tool for detection that:

1. Loads an annotation library from `data/library.json` (or seeds a starter set).
2. Parses image records with file name, dimensions, and object lists.
3. Validates and clips each bounding box to legal image coordinates.
4. Converts pixel-space `x,y,w,h` to normalized YOLO `cx,cy,w,h`.
5. Computes per-annotation area and basic quality flags.
6. Builds a category index for compact numeric class IDs.
7. Exports COCO JSON (`images`, `annotations`, `categories`) for downstream tooling.
8. Exports YOLO label rows for lightweight training workflows.
9. Exports Pascal VOC XML files for interoperability with VOC-compatible tools.
10. Persists per-annotation metadata and run summaries for history and auditing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- No external dependencies - the annotation engine uses stdlib only.
