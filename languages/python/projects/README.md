# Python Projects

Project format
- Each project lives in: /languages/python/projects/<project-name>/
  - README.md — step-by-step project guide and objectives
  - starter/ — skeleton code and instructions to start
  - final/ — complete implementation
  - tests/ — optional test suite
  - walkthrough.ipynb — optional Jupyter notebook walkthrough

Project expectations
- The README should include: objective, prerequisites, estimated time, learning outcomes, and step-by-step milestones.
- Starter code should intentionally leave key parts for the learner to implement.
- Final code should be well-documented and tested.

Sample project skeleton: sample-todo-app
- Purpose: small command-line TODO app to learn file I/O and basic data modeling.
- Included below is the skeleton folder structure and a placeholder notebook walkthrough.

Project: study-session-tracker
- Purpose: command-line study log app to practice JSON persistence, aggregation, and CLI subcommands.
- Includes: starter implementation with TODOs, final reference implementation, and a complete walkthrough notebook.

Project: interview-patterns-api
- Purpose: FastAPI service that applies interview algorithms to real API endpoints and practice insights.
- Includes: starter TODO API, final reference API, requirements file, and walkthrough notebook.
