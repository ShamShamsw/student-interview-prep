# Python — student-interview-prep

Python is prioritized as the first language for content development.

Recommended environment
- Python 3.10+ is recommended.
- Use virtual environments (venv) or conda.
- Formatting: follow PEP8; use `black` and `isort` where appropriate.

Running examples
- Simple runnable examples: run via `python file.py`.
- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) are used for short walkthroughs. Open with `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`.

Structure for this language
- /languages/python/problems — problem statements and canonical solutions
- /languages/python/projects — guided projects with starter/ and final/ folders and an optional notebook walkthrough
- /languages/python/problems/tests — reusable pytest harness for validating canonical solutions
- /languages/python/cheatsheet.md (optional)

Contributing Python content
- Use the problem and project templates from CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Include tests where feasible (pytest recommended).
- Keep notebooks concise (focused on one concept).

Example: a problem file should follow the naming pattern `NN-description.md` and include metadata and examples.
