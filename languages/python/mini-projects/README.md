# Mini-Projects

Bite-sized projects (1–2 hours each) that bridge the gap between individual coding problems and the full multi-week projects. Each one practices a specific concept in a realistic context.

## Why Mini-Projects?

- **Individual problems** (10–20 min) teach one algorithm at a time
- **Mini-projects** (1–2 hours) combine multiple concepts into a small working program
- **Full projects** (1–4 weeks) build production-style applications

Mini-projects fill the critical gap where you go from "I can solve Two Sum" to "I can build things."

| 02 | [Markdown Link Checker](02-markdown-link-checker/README.md) | File I/O, regex, HTTP requests | 1–1.5 hr |
| 03 | [Rate Limiter](03-rate-limiter/README.md) | Sliding window, time-based logic, decorators | 1–2 hr |
| 04 | [Stack-Based Calculator](04-stack-calculator/README.md) | Stack, parsing, expression evaluation | 1–1.5 hr |

## How to Use

1. Read the mini-project README for requirements
2. Implement it from scratch — don't peek at the solution first
3. Write tests as you go (at least 3-5)
4. Compare your approach with the provided solution
5. Try the stretch goals if you finish early

## Tips

- Set a timer. If you're stuck for over 20 minutes, look at the hints
- Write tests FIRST for at least one function — practice TDD
- Start with the simplest working version, then improve
