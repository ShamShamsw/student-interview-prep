# Weekly Confidence Check

Use this every week to avoid overload and adapt your plan.

## Step 1: Score yourself (1-5)

Rate each item from 1 (low) to 5 (high):

1. I understand this week's topics.
2. I can solve at least one problem without hints.
3. I can explain one solution in plain language.
4. I can run and interpret tests.
5. My stress level feels manageable.

Total score: ____ / 25

## Step 2: Decide your mode for next week

  - Keep current pace.
  - Add one stretch task.
- **14-19 (Yellow mode)**

  - Add one review session.
- **5-13 (Red mode)**
  - Pause new topics for 3-5 days.
  - Revisit fundamentals and easy problems only.
  - Focus on one project task and one concept.
