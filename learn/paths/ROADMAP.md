# ROADMAP

This roadmap focuses on product and technical milestones. Marketing/outreach will be kept separate.

Phase 0 — Setup (Week 0)
- Decide repo name & licenses.
- Add README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, CONTENT_LICENSE.
- Add Python language scaffold and templates.

Phase 1 — MVP (Weeks 1–8)
- Prioritize Python:
  - 20–50 curated Python problems (easy/medium/hard mix)
  - 5–10 short notebook walkthroughs
  - 3 guided projects with starter + final implementations
- Prepare templates for other languages: Java, C++, JavaScript, SQL.

Phase 2 — Community & Growth (Months 2–4)
- Onboard initial contributors and reviewers.
- Add issue templates and labels (`good first issue`, `help wanted`).
- Add CI for runnable problems (GitHub Actions).

Phase 3 — Scaling (Months 4–12)
- Add additional language sections (Java, C++, JavaScript, SQL).
- Add tests & automated checks for runnable problems.
- Track metrics (stars, contributors, GitHub traffic, mailing list signups).

Notes
- Owner will manage GitHub Pages separately.
- This document is iterative — update as the project evolves.
