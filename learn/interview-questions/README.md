# Interview Questions

A categorized collection of questions you'll encounter in technical interviews — from behavioral basics to role-specific deep dives.

## How to Use This

1. **Read** the [Interview Preparation Guide](07-interview-preparation-guide.md) — what to bring, company research, in-person vs. virtual etiquette
2. **Learn** [How to Ask & Answer Questions](00-how-to-ask-and-answer.md) — frameworks for structuring every answer
3. **Practice** [Behavioral Questions](01-behavioral.md) — these appear in every interview regardless of role
4. **Pick your track** based on the role you're targeting:

| File | Best For |
|------|----------|
| [Basic Technical](02-basic-technical.md) | All roles — CS fundamentals everyone should know |
| [Frontend](03-frontend.md) | Frontend / UI engineer roles |
| [Backend](04-backend.md) | Backend / API / infrastructure roles |
| [Fullstack](05-fullstack.md) | Fullstack roles that span both |
| [Advanced Technical](06-advanced.md) | Senior-level / system design / architecture |
| [Data Science](08-data-science.md) | Data analyst / data scientist / ML engineer roles |
| [Interview Preparation Guide](07-interview-preparation-guide.md) | Logistics, etiquette, and what to do before/during/after |

## Study Plan

**Week 1–2:** Behavioral + Basic Technical (2 questions per day)
**Week 3–4:** Your role-specific track (2–3 questions per day)
**Week 5+:** Advanced + mock interviews with [Mock Interview Guide](../guides/MOCK_INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md)

## Quick Tips

- Answer out loud, not just in your head — interviews are verbal
- Record yourself and listen back (awkward but effective)
- Keep answers to 60–90 seconds for behavioral, 2–5 minutes for technical
- It's fine to say "I don't know, but here's how I'd figure it out"
- Always have 2–3 questions ready to ask _your interviewer_ (see [How to Ask & Answer](00-how-to-ask-and-answer.md#questions-to-ask-your-interviewer))
