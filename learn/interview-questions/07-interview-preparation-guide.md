# Interview Preparation Guide

A beginner's guide to everything _around_ the interview — what to do before, during, and after, so you can walk in confident and focused on what matters: showing what you know.

## Before the Interview

### Researching the Company

Do this for every company, even if it's "just a phone screen."

1. **Visit the company website** — read the About page, understand what they build and who they serve.
2. **Check their engineering blog** (if they have one) — shows what tech stack they use, problems they solve, and how they think.
3. **Read recent news** — Google the company name + "news" for the past 3 months. Know about funding rounds, product launches, or leadership changes.
4. **Look at the job description again** — highlight keywords (languages, frameworks, methodologies). These hint at what they'll ask.
5. **Explore their GitHub** (if open-source) — browse recent repos, read a few READMEs. This gives you real talking points.
6. **Check Glassdoor / Levels.fyi** — look for interview experience reviews to understand the typical process and question style.
7. **Understand their product** — if possible, sign up and use it. Nothing impresses more than "I tried your product and noticed..."

**Prepare 2–3 sentences** that answer: _"What does this company do!?"_ and _"Why do I want to work here?"_ You will be asked some version of these.

### What to Bring (In-Person)

- **Multiple copies of your resume** (3–5) — printed on clean, white paper
- **A notebook and pen** — for jotting down names, notes, or questions
- **A portfolio or laptop** (if asked) — have projects ready to demo, pre-loaded and tested
- **Government-issued ID** — some offices require it for building access
- **Water bottle** — staying hydrated helps you think clearly
- **Breath mints / gum** (discard before the interview starts)
- **Charger / backup battery** — if you're demoing from a laptop
- **Directions and parking info** — scout the location the day before if you can

**Do NOT bring:** food, large bags, strong perfume/cologne, anyone else (no friends or family in the lobby).

### What to Prepare (Virtual / Online)

- **Test your setup the day before:**
  - Camera, microphone, speakers/headphones
  - Internet connection (use ethernet if possible)
  - The meeting software (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) — install it, log in, make sure it works
- **Environment checklist:**
  - Quiet room with a door you can close
  - Neutral or tidy background (or use a simple virtual background)
  - Good lighting — face a window or put a lamp behind your monitor
  - Remove notifications — put your phone on silent, close Slack/Discord/email
- **Have ready on your screen:**
  - A text editor or IDE (for live coding)
  - The job description in a tab
  - Your resume in a tab (so you can reference what you wrote)
  - A notes doc with your prepared questions for the interviewer

### The Night Before

- Lay out your clothes (business casual is safe unless told otherwise)
- Charge your devices
- Review your resume — you should be able to explain every bullet point
- Review 3–5 of your prepared answers (behavioral + technical)
- Get a full night of sleep — seriously, this matters more than one more hour of cramming
- Set two alarms

## During the Interview

### In-Person Etiquette

- **Arrive 10–15 minutes early** — not 30 minutes early, not 2 minutes late
- **Be kind to everyone** — receptionists, security, people in the elevator. Companies sometimes ask them for impressions
- **Handshake** — firm, brief, with eye contact and a smile
- **Sit up straight, make eye contact** — but don't stare. It's a conversation, not an interrogation
- **Put your phone away** — completely away, not face-down on the table
- **Take notes** — it shows you care and helps you remember names
- **Ask for clarification** — if you don't understand a question, say "Could you rephrase that?" or "Just to make sure I understand, you're asking about X?"
- **Think out loud** — silence feels awkward to interviewers. Narrate your thought process even when you're stuck

### Virtual / Online Etiquette

- **Join 2–3 minutes early** — not 10 minutes early (they might not be ready)
- **Camera ON** unless told otherwise — it builds connection and trust
- **Look at the camera, not the screen** — this simulates eye contact
- **Mute when not speaking** (in panel interviews) — unmute before answering
- **Speak slightly slower than normal** — audio delay can make fast speech hard to follow
- **Share your screen smoothly** — practice screen sharing before the interview. Know which window to share
- **If tech breaks:** stay calm, say "I'm having a connection issue, one moment." Reconnect. It happens to everyone
- **For live coding:** use a clean editor with a comfortable font size. Zoom in so they can read your code

### Answering Questions

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| You know the answer | Give a concise answer, then offer to go deeper: _"Would you like me to elaborate?"_ |
| You partially know | Share what you know, then be honest: _"I'm not 100% sure about X, but here's what I'd try..."_ |
| You don't know at all | Say: _"I haven't worked with that directly, but based on what I know about Y, I'd approach it by..."_ |
| You need time to think | Say: _"Great question — let me think about that for a moment."_ (Silence is OK.) |
| You made a mistake | Correct yourself: _"Actually, let me revise that — I think a better answer is..."_ |

### Body Language Tips

- **Lean slightly forward** — shows engagement
- **Nod occasionally** — shows you're listening
- **Smile naturally** — interviews are conversations, not exams
- **Avoid fidgeting** — no pen clicking, hair twirling, or bouncing your leg
- **Mirror the interviewer's energy** — if they're casual, relax a little. If they're formal, match it

## After the Interview

### Same Day (Within 2–4 Hours)

1. **Send a thank-you email** to each person who interviewed you. Keep it short:
   > _Hi [Name],_
   >
   > _Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the [Role] position. I enjoyed learning about [something specific from the conversation — e.g., "the team's approach to code reviews" or "the migration to microservices"]. I'm excited about the opportunity and look forward to hearing from you._
   >
   > _Best, [Your Name]_

2. **Write down what you remember** — questions asked, your answers, things you want to improve. This is gold for your next interview.

### While Waiting to Hear Back

- Don't stop interviewing elsewhere — keep your pipeline active
- If they gave you a timeline ("we'll get back to you by Friday"), wait until the day after before following up
- Follow-up email should be brief: _"Hi [Name], I wanted to check in on the timeline for the [Role] position. I remain very interested. Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me."_
- If you don't hear back after two follow-ups, move on — but don't burn the bridge

### If You Get an Offer

- **Don't accept on the spot** — say: _"Thank you! I'm very excited. Could I have [2–3 days / until Friday] to review the details?"_
- Review: salary, benefits, start date, remote policy, team, growth path
- It's OK to negotiate — especially if you have competing offers or market data

### If You Get Rejected

- **Reply graciously:** _"Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate the opportunity and your time. I'd love to be considered for future openings."_
- Ask for feedback (they might not give it, but it doesn't hurt to ask): _"If possible, I'd appreciate any feedback on areas I could improve."_
- Review your notes from the interview — what questions tripped you up? Add those to your study list
- **It's not personal.** Even great candidates get rejected. The best thing you can do is improve and try again

## Common Mistakes Beginners Make

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Not researching the company | Spend 20 minutes minimum before every interview |
| Memorizing answers word-for-word | Know your key points, but speak naturally |
| Saying "I don't know" and stopping | Always follow with "but here's how I'd figure it out" |
| Talking too long | Practice the 60-second rule: if you've been talking for over a minute without a pause, check in |
| Not asking questions | Always have 2–3 ready (see [How to Ask & Answer](00-how-to-ask-and-answer.md#questions-to-ask-your-interviewer)) |
| Badmouthing a previous employer | Never. Focus on what you learned or what you're looking for next |
| Ignoring the behavioral round | Technical skill gets you in the door. Behavioral answers get you the offer |
| Not following up | A thank-you email takes 5 minutes and sets you apart |

## Dress Code Quick Reference

| Interview Type | What to Wear |
|---------------|--------------|
| Startup / casual culture | Clean jeans + a nice top or polo. No holes, no graphic tees |
| Standard tech company | Business casual — chinos/slacks + button-down or blouse |
| Enterprise / corporate | Business casual to business formal — slacks + blazer or dress shirt |
| Virtual interview | Dress from the waist up at minimum. Solid colors read better on camera |

**When in doubt:** business casual is almost always safe. Overdressing slightly is better than underdressing.

## Remember

- Every interview, even a bad one, makes you better at the next one
