# Beginner Start Here

If you are new to IT, open source, and coding projects, use this file first.

## Goal for your first 2 weeks

- Understand basic workflow (read -> code -> test -> reflect)
- Build confidence with small wins
- Avoid overwhelm by limiting scope

## Daily session format (60-90 minutes)

1. **Learn (20-30 min)**
   - Read one small section from a problem or project README.
2. **Do (30-45 min)**
   - Solve one easy problem or one small TODO function.
3. **Reflect (5-10 min)**
   - Write 3 bullets:
     - what I understood
     - what was confusing
     - next action

## Week 1 (daily plan)

### Day 1
- Read [LEARNING_PATH.md](../paths/LEARNING_PATH.md) and pick the 12-week track.
- Open [LEARNING_PATH_CHECKLIST.md](../paths/LEARNING_PATH_CHECKLIST.md) and check your track.

### Day 2
- Solve problem 01 (`two-sum`) with notes.
- Compare with canonical solution and write one takeaway.

### Day 3
- Solve problem 02 (`valid-parentheses`) and explain stack idea in plain words.

### Day 4
- Run `sample-to-do-app/final` commands.
- Observe how add/list/done/remove/clear work.

### Day 5
- Implement first TODO function in `sample-to-do-app/starter/app.py`.

### Day 6
- Implement second TODO function and run commands again.

### Day 7
- Weekly review:
  - what felt easy
  - what felt hard
  - what to focus next week

## Week 2 (daily plan)

- Continue `sample-to-do-app/starter/app.py` TODOs.
- Solve 2-3 additional easy problems from Week 1 list.
- Run tests once at end of week.
- Complete one weekly confidence check from [../checklists/WEEKLY_CONFIDENCE_CHECK.md](../checklists/WEEKLY_CONFIDENCE_CHECK.md).

## Interview questions (start here)

- Use [../guides/INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS.md](../guides/INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS.md) for beginner-friendly interview practice.
- Practice answering 2 questions out loud after each coding session.

## Beginner rules (anti-overwhelm)

- One active goal per session.
- No more than 90 minutes per session.
- Stop multitasking between multiple projects.
- Use failing tests/errors as guides, not as proof you are bad.

## If you are stuck

Use [../paths/LEARNING_PATH.md](../paths/LEARNING_PATH.md) section **"Stuck? Troubleshoot and Re-approach"**.

## Next after week 2

Move into the 12-week track milestones in [../paths/LEARNING_PATH.md](../paths/LEARNING_PATH.md).
