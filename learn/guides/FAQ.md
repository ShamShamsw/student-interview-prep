# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Quick answers to common questions about using this repository.

## Getting Started

### Q: I'm completely new to coding. Where do I start?

Start with [../guides/BEGINNER_START_HERE.md](BEGINNER_START_HERE.md). Follow the Week 1 daily plan exactly. Don't skip ahead or try to do multiple things at once.

### Q: What programming language should I learn first?

This repository currently focuses on **Python** because it:
- Has simpler syntax than Java/C++
- Is widely used in interviews
- Has great learning resources

If your target role requires a specific language (like Java for Android), focus on that instead.
