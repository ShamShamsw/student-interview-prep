## How to use these without overwhelm

- Pick **one** resource per category, not all.
- Set a weekly cap: 1-2 external resources max.
- Convert every resource session into one action in this repo:
  - solve one problem
  - improve one test
  - add one project task

If a resource does not produce practical repo progress within 2 sessions, replace it.
